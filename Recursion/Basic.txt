-> What is Recursion?

Recursion is when a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It usually has two main parts:

Base Case – The condition when the recursion stops.

Recursive Case – The part where the function calls itself with new arguments, gradually moving towards the base case.



-> Important Tips

Always have a base case to prevent infinite recursion.

Recursion can be memory-heavy for large inputs — consider iteration or memoization for optimization.

Use recursion for problems that can be broken into smaller subproblems, like trees, arrays, or mathematical sequences.
